# Neutrino Mass
## COMP90071 Art of Scientific Computing Repository
### Neutrino Project

NeutrinoMass is a code that shows the various methods to place constraints on the mass of the neutrino. These methods include experimental data and MonteCarlo Simulations.
It is written in Python and run in a Jupyter Notebook. 
The notebook contains interactive code that allows the user to change plots and explore the effect of parameters on simulations. 

## Prerequisites

NeutrinoMass should be run with Python version 3.6.3.

## Installing

Experienced programmers can download the files from the repository and run the jupyter notebook (NeutrinoMass.ipynb)
Below is the list of packages that are needed, most are typically with any python install.

* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Scipy
* Numpy
* ipywidgets
* jupyter

To install any of these packages ```conda install ``` or ```pip install ``` with the desired package name after will work on most systems.

To install the notebook open the terminal and in a clean git repository (```git init```) use the command ```git pull https://github.com/KylaAdams5/NeutrinoMass &```. The ```&``` allows the notebook to run in the background of the terminal.
To end the notebook in the terminal press ```fg``` then ```control + c```. 

If the notebook already has been run press ```esc```, ```0```, ```c``` to clear all outputs.

## Running

To run the code in the terminal go to the directory where the Neutrino Mass code was saved and run ```jupyter notebook NeutrinoMass.ipynb```
