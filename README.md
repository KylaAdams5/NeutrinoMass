# Vigilante
## PHYC9007 Art of Scientific Computing Repository
### Neutrino Project

Vigilante is a code that shows the various methods to place constraints on the mass of the neutrino. These methods include experimental data and MonteCarlo Simulations.
It is written in Python and run in a Jupyter Notebook. 
The notebook contains interactive code that allows the user to change plots and explore the effect of parameters on simulations. 

## Prerequisites

Vigilante should be run with Python version 3.6.3.

## Installing

Experienced programmers can download the files from the repository and run the jupyter notebook (NeutrinoMass.ipynb)
Below is the list of packages that are needed, most are typically with any python install.

* Matplotlib
* pandas
* scipy
* numpy
* ipywidgets
* jupyter

to install any of these packages ```conda install ``` or ```pip install ``` will work on most systems.

## Running

To run the code in the terminal go to the directory where the Vigilante code was saved and run ```jupyter notebook NeutrinoMass.ipynb```

## Authors
The project was written by Kyla Adams, based on the guidelines given by Innes Bigaran for the Masters unit PHYC9007 at the University of Melbourne.
