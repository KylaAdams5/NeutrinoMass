    "# Determining the Mass of the Neutrino\n",
    "\n",
    "NeutrinoMass is a code that shows the various methods to place constraints on the mass of the neutrino. These methods include experimental data and MonteCarlo Simulations. It is written in Python and run in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains interactive code that allows the user to change plots and explore the effect of parameters on simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook is based off of the project designed for the COMP-90072 Masters Unit at the University of Melbourne. The file *Determing the mass of the neutrino.pdf* contains the final report. The report outlines the intermediate steps and justifications for using certain methods here. The document is able to be used separately and in conjunction with this notebook, depending on the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Neutrino has had a long history in physics, it was first postulated by Pauli in 1930 and 'discovered' around 1950 and colminated in a nobel prize. However, it's exact mass is not yet known. There are many experiments around the world aiming to determine its mass. These experiments, in order to gaim funding they need to show that they will actually see something. How can this be done? By numerical simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will teach you how to use your computer, through the programing language python, how do place some limits on the neutirno mass that can be used to inform future experiments. It can be completed in tandem with the pdf found in the GitHub repository [NeutrinoMass](https://github.com/KylaAdams5/NeutrinoMass). The relevant chapters and sections for each code section is outlined.  "

    "Python documentation and code is to import the desired packages. Packages are prewritten code that can do a variety of functions. There are many pros and cons for importing packages. The pros are that the amount of code that one needs to write will only be specific to what you need (i.e. how to import a particular data set, not data in general). The payoff for using these functions is that they often have many assumptions built into them and the steps used are often hidden within the source code.\n",
